          <h3 id="headline">Timeline of Alan Turing's Life: </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> 23 June 1912: </strong> Alan Mathison Turing was born in
              London
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> 1926: </strong> Aged 14, he was sent to Sherborne School
              in Dorset. His first day of term coincided with the 1926 General
              Strike. Turing was so determined not to miss his first day of
              school that he cycled the 97km from his home in Southampton. His
              teachers worried that he leaned too heavily towards maths and
              science, at the expense of the classics. The headmaster wrote to
              his parents: "If he is to be solely a scientific specialist, he is
              wasting his time at a public school".
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1927: </strong>At the age of 16, Turing got to grips with
              Albert Einstein's work and extrapolated Einstein's questioning of
              Newton's Laws of Motion from a text in which this was never made
              explicit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1930: </strong>Turing's close school friend Christopher
              Morcom dies suddenly from bovine tuberculosis. Turing renounces
              his religious faith and becomes an atheist.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1931: </strong>Turing goes to study Mathematics at King's
              College, Cambridge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1935: </strong>Turing proves the central limit theorem in
              his dissertation and is made a fellow at King's at the age of just
              22.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1936: </strong>Turing published his paper On Computable
              Numbers and an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision
              problem) in which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later
              became known as the Turing Machine. This was an idealised
              computing device that is capable of performing any mathematical
              computation that can be represented as an algorithm.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1936-1938: </strong>Turing spent time at Princeton in the
              US studying under Alonzo Church. There he started to study
              cryptology as well as mathematics. In 1938 he received his PhD;
              his dissertation was called Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals and
              introduced original logic and relative computing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>September 1938: </strong>Turing started to work part-time
              at the Government Code and Cypher School.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1939: </strong>The day after war is declared in September
              1939, Turing arrives at Bletchley Park. There he works with Gordon
              Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the
              messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. The Bombe
              built on a machine that the Polish had already made, called the
              Bomba Kryptlogiczna. Turing used statistical techniques to
              optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code-breaking
              process using probability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1941: </strong>Turing proposes to his co-worker Joan
              Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst. Shortly after,
              Turing had second thoughts, admitting to his fiancee that he was
              homosexual.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1941-43: </strong>Turing and colleagues manage to break
              the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is extremely
              helpful for the Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic as it
              could help them avoid the fearsome German U-boats, which had been
              responsible for sinking more than 700 Allied ships with 2.3
              million tons of vital cargo.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1945: </strong>At the end of World War II, Turing is
              awarded an OBE for his services to his country
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>October 1945: </strong>Turing joined the National Physical
              Laboratory where he worked on developing an electronic digital
              stored-program computing machine that would later become the ACE
              (Automatic Computing Engine). By 1946 he had a finished proposal
              for the computer, but NPL did not have the resources to turn it
              into reality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1947: </strong>Turing returned to Cambridge for a
              sabbatical year. The Pilot ACE was built in his absence and
              executed its first program on 10 May 1950.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1949: </strong>: Turing became deputy director of the
              Computing Laboratory at Manchester University, working on software
              for one of the earliest stored program computers â€“ the Manchester
              Mark 1. He also explored the problem of artificial intelligence
              and proposed an experiment (in his seminal paper Computing
              Machinery and Intelligence) which became that attempted to define
              a standard for machine intelligence, which would later become
              known as the Turing test. The core idea was that a computer could
              be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it
              apart, through conversation, from a human being. Turing also
              worked with his former colleague D G Champernowne on a chess
              program for a computer that did not exist yet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1952: </strong>Without a computer powerful enough to
              execute his chess program, Turing played a game in which he
              simulated the computer, taking about half an hour to perform each
              move. The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, but
              won against Champernowne's wife.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>January 1952: </strong>Turing meets a man called Arnold
              Murray and invites him over to his house. Murray visits Turing's
              house on a number of occasions, staying the night. Murray later
              helps an accomplice break into Turing's house. Turing reports the
              crime and admits having a sexual relationship with Murray.
              Homosexual acts are illegal in the UK and so both were charged
              with gross indecency. Turing is given the choice of being
              imprisoned or chemically castrated with oestrogen hormone
              injections. He chooses the latter. Turing's conviction means his
              security clearance is removed which means he is barred from his
              cryptographic consultancy for the British government.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>08 June 1954: </strong>Turing's cleaner finds him dead. It
              appears that Turing poisoned himself using a cyanide-laced apple.
